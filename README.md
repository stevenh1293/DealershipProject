CarDealer contains the scraped data.

PBI contains the Power BI model which is in the very early stages.

Power Automate/Brandon Honda contains a walkthrough of the Power Automate Scrapers.

Powershell contains the powershell script to run the pyton file in task scheduler.

Python contains the Python file used to import the extracted data in the excel files to SQL.

SSMS contains all the SQL files used to create the tables and stored procedures to process the raw data.

The total time invested in this project so far is maybe 15 hours, so there is still a lot of work to be done. However, it demonstrates how quickly a data pipeline can be created with Power Automate, Python, SQL, and Power BI.
